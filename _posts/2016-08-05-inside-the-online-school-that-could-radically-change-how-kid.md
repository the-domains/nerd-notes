  Emily Duggan, 16, spends most afternoons at a dance studio tucked behind a
  shopping plaza near her home in Exeter, New Hampshire. Blond and doe-eyed,
  Duggan has been dancing since she was two, everything from tap to ballet. She
  puts in about 12 hours a week at the studio, including classes and rehearsals
  with the dance team for weekend competitions.
